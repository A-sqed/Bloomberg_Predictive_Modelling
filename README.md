## System requirements:

1. Downloaded the Program and Data Files contained in this repository (you can download the entire repo as zip, then extract them)
2. have a Anaconda python distribution installed on your computer
3. make sure the installed Pandas library is lower than v1.1.0
4. run "pip install streamlit" to install the library streamlit

## To preprocess newly extracted data from Bloomberg terminal:

1. ```
    Open the Economic Data Cleaning.ipynb using Jupyter notebook
   ```
2. ```
    Modify the second cell of input data to be the Bloomberg extract that you wish to process. e.g. 'DATA_PULL_BB_080120_HC.xlsx'
   ```
3. ```
    Modify the last cell of output filename as needed e.g. 'Economic_data_clean_20200801.xlsx'
   ```
4. ```
    Run all the cells to generate the clean output file that can be served to the program.
   ```

- ```
   The example raw dataset (from Bloomberg) and processed dataset (excel) are available in this repository. 
  ```

## To run the Web Application:

1. ```
    Go to your terminal and move to the directory where the Application.py code is
   ```
2. ```
    In the terminal type “streamlit run webapp.py”
   ```
3. ```
    Click on the top IP address link that is generated (should take you to the browser)
   ```
4. ```
    On the left, select an excel file, e.g. the (Economic_data_clean_20200801.xlsx)
   ```
5. ```
    On the left, select a start and end time for data to train on
   ```
6. ```
    Press the “Train Model” button
   ```

## Additional Options For The Web Application:

1. ```
    Press “Display Historical Data Table?” to see the data we’re using.
   ```
2. ```
    Click in the “View Historical Indices” search field. You can select multiple other factors and see how those factors compares to the target variables.
   ```
3. ```
    On the left, can press on “Feature Importance”. On the page can pick “which model?”, the number picked shows the graphs when the model forecasts is that number of days ahead
   ```
4. ```
    On the left, can press on “Model Performance”. On the page can pick “which model?”, the number picked shows the graphs when the model forecasts is that number of days ahead
   ```

## Prediction and Forecast Interpretation:

1. ```
    The written recommendation. The top written prediction is for the CDX HY, the bottom written prediction is for the CDX IG
   ```
2. ```
    Each row represent different days.
   ```
3. ```
    Green arrow up, means the model predicts the corresponding CDX will increase. Red arrow down, means the model predicts the corresponding CDX will decrease.
   ```

## Prediction and Forecast Column Label Interpretation:
